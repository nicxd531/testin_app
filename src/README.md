Deployment
To deploy a React application built in an npm environment, begin by ensuring that your project is properly configured and dependencies are installed. Run the necessary build command, typically 'npm run build', to generate the production-ready files. Once the build is successful, you can use a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or deploy it manually to a server. Ensure that the server is set up to serve the static files generated in the 'build' folder. Update any necessary environment variables for production settings, and your React application should be ready for deployment. Don't forget to test thoroughly in the production environment to ensure a smooth and error-free deployment.

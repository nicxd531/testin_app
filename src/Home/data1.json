It revolves around components, reusable UI pieces managed through a virtual DOM. Using JSX syntax, it offers a unidirectional data flow, and components can manage local state and receive data via props. React Router facilitates navigation, while state management can be handled using React's built-in features or external libraries like Redux. Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow functional components to use state and other React features. Overall, React provides an efficient and declarative approach to building interactive web interfaces.",

It centralizes and manages the application's state in a single store, making state changes predictable and traceable. Actions are dispatched to trigger state updates, and pure functions called reducers specify how the state should change in response to actions. Redux enables a unidirectional data flow and simplifies state management in complex applications by providing a clear structure for handling and updating application state.",
